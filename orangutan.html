			<h2>Background Information</h2>
			<p>Orangutans are great apes native to the rainforests of Indonesia and Malaysia. They are now found only in parts of Borneo and Sumatra, but during the Pleistocene they ranged throughout Southeast Asia and South China. Classified in the genus Pongo, orangutans were originally considered to be one species. From 1996, they were divided into two species: the Bornean orangutan (P. pygmaeus, with three subspecies) and the Sumatran orangutan (P. abelii). A third species, the Tapanuli orangutan (P. tapanuliensis), was identified definitively in 2017. The orangutans are the only surviving species of the subfamily Ponginae, which diverged genetically from the other hominids (gorillas, chimpanzees, and humans) between 19.3 and 15.7 million years ago.

				The most arboreal of the great apes, orangutans spend most of their time in trees. They have proportionally long arms and short legs, and have reddish-brown hair covering their bodies. Adult males weigh about 75 kg (165 lb), while females reach about 37 kg (82 lb). Dominant adult males develop distinctive cheek pads or flanges and make long calls that attract females and intimidate rivals; younger subordinate males do not and more resemble adult females. Orangutans are the most solitary of the great apes: social bonds occur primarily between mothers and their dependent offspring, who remain together for two years. Fruit is the most important component of an orangutan's diet; but they will also eat vegetation, bark, honey, insects and bird eggs. They can live over 30 years, both in the wild and in captivity.
				
				Orangutans are among the most intelligent primates. They use a variety of sophisticated tools and construct elaborate sleeping nests each night from branches and foliage. The apes' learning abilities have been studied extensively. There may be distinctive cultures within populations. Orangutans have been featured in literature and art since at least the 18th century, particularly in works that comment on human society. Field studies of the apes were pioneered by primatologist Birutė Galdikas and they have been kept in captive facilities around the world since at least the early 19th century.
				
				All three orangutan species are considered critically endangered. Human activities have caused severe declines in populations and ranges. Threats to wild orangutan populations include poaching (for bushmeat and retaliation for consuming crops), habitat destruction and deforestation (for palm oil cultivation and logging), and the illegal pet trade. Several conservation and rehabilitation organisations are dedicated to the survival of orangutans in the wild.</p>

			<h2>Why it's important</h2>
			<p>All three species are critically endangered according to the IUCN Red List of mammals.[109][110][111] They are legally protected from capture, harm or killing in both Malaysia and Indonesia,[112] and are listed under Appendix I by CITES, which prohibits their unlicensed trade under international law.[113] The Bornean orangutan range has become patchy, being largely extirpated from several parts of the island, including the southeast.[110] The largest remaining population is found in the forest around the Sabangau River, but this environment is at risk.[114] The Sumatran orangutan is found only in the northern part of Sumatra, most of the population inhabiting the Leuser Ecosystem.[109] The Tapanuli orangutan is found only in the Batang Toru forest of Sumatra.
				Birutė Galdikas wrote that orangutans were already endangered by poaching and deforestation when she began studying them in 1971.[115] During the early 2000s, orangutan habitats decreased rapidly because of logging and forest fires, and fragmentation by roads. A major factor has been the conversion of vast areas of tropical forest to palm oil plantations in response to international demand. Hunting is also a major problem, as is the illegal pet trade.[109][110] Orangutans may be killed for the bushmeat trade[116] and bones are secretly traded in souvenir shops in several cities in Indonesian Borneo.[117] Conflicts between locals and orangutans also pose a threat. Orangutans that have lost their homes often raid agricultural areas and end up being killed by villagers.[118] Locals may also be motivated to kill orangutans for food or because of fear and self-defense.[119] Mother orangutans are killed so their infants can be sold as pets, and many of these infants die without the help of their mother. Since 2012, the Indonesian authorities, with the aid of the Orangutan Information Center, confiscated 114 orangutans, 39 of which were pets.[120]

Estimates between 2000 and 2003 found 7,300 Sumatran orangutans[109] and between 45,000 and 69,000 Bornean orangutans[110] remain in the wild.[121] A 2016 study estimates a population of 14,613 Sumatran orangutans in the wild, doubling previous population estimates.[122] Fewer than 800 Tapanuli orangutan are estimated to still exist, which puts the species among the most endangered of the great apes.[123][40] The table below shows a breakdown of the species and subspecies and their estimated populations from this or (in the case of P. tapanuliensis) a 2017 report:
